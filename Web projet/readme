        7.AUTHOR
        
-> Praveen M
-> MCA Student | Frontend Developer
-> I created this Health Food Products E-Commerce Website project as part of my interview selection process.
   The entire project was developed using only frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).I built this project 
   independently during my summer leave in July 2025, using Visual Studio Code and the GoLive extension to
   simulate a real-world e-commerce experience. This project reflects my hands-on ability to design, code,and 
   deliver a fully functional and responsive UI from scratch.
-> I also used AI tools (like ChatGPT,gemini,deepseek,copilot etc.....) for guidance, reference, and to enhance
   development efficiency — making the process faster and more effective.
